Samuel Morse was away from home when his wife got seriously ill. The messenger immediately started to deliver this news to Morse. By the time the messenger reached back home and Morse was back home, his wife was already buried a week ago. This shock shook Morse to his core, leaving an impact which he carried for the rest of his life.

A decade passed. Morse met an engineer who introduced him to electricity and magnetism. He started to see a possibility of faster message transfer. Despite not being a formally trained engineer, driven by the memories of his wife, he invented a messaging system using a wire, a battery, and an electromagnet. He called it a telegraph.

For the first time in history, messages would reach their destination before the messenger. In those days, this achievement was no less than a sorcery.

The invention of the telegraph not only redefined how information was shared, it also redefined business, administration, and international relations.

The telegraph changed the way the world worked for the next 100 years.

The telegraph proved pivotal at many points in history.

Abraham Lincoln used timely information updates via telegraph to plan well-informed strategies in the American Civil War.

Trans-Atlantic telephony helped in stabilizing the stock market and international relations between the U.S. and Europe.

Innumerable halts and collisions in railways were prevented from happening just because relevant information reached railway stations on time, saving thousands of lives.

This is just another example of how a troubled heart and an observant mind of an individual can change the course of human history.
